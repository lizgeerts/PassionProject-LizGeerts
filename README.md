## Resources

Since it is a passion project Development, I did not have the time 
to design all the 3D objects myself. These are the assets I used from the asset store:

- Fantasy Skybox FREE by Render Knight https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-free-18353 
- SimplePoly City - Low Poly Assets by VenCreations https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/simplepoly-city-low-poly-assets-58899
